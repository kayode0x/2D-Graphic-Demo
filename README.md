# Snake Game

The Snake Game is a classic two-dimensional game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, the player controls a growing snake, maneuvering it around the screen to eat food and avoid collisions with the walls or its own body. The objective is to eat as much food as possible and achieve a high score.

## How the Game Works:
Here's an overview of the Snake Game:

- The game features a grid-based game board represented by the HTML Canvas element.
- The snake starts with a few initial segments and grows longer as it eats food.
- The player controls the snake's movement using the arrow keys on the keyboard.
- The snake moves in the direction indicated by the arrow key and cannot reverse its direction to avoid colliding with its own body.
- The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
- Food appears at random positions on the game board, and when the snake eats it, it grows longer, and the player earns points.
- The player's score is displayed during the game.
- The game speed increases gradually as the snake grows, creating a more challenging experience.

## Key Learning Points:
During the development of this game, you can learn the following key points:

- Utilizing HTML5 Canvas: The game utilizes the HTML5 canvas element to draw the game board, snake, and food, as well as handle rendering and animations.

- JavaScript Game Development: JavaScript is used to handle game mechanics, such as moving the snake, detecting collisions, updating the score, and managing game over conditions.

- Event Handling: The game captures keyboard events to control the snake's movement and handle game restarts.

- Animation and Frame Rendering: The game employs the `requestAnimationFrame` method to achieve smooth animation and frame rendering.

## How to Play:
To enjoy the Snake Game, follow these steps:

- Open the HTML file (called "index.html") provided in a web browser that supports HTML5 canvas.

- The game will start automatically, and you can control the snake's movement using the arrow keys on your keyboard.

- Guide the snake to eat the food that appears on the board to grow longer and earn points.

- Be careful not to let the snake collide with the walls or its own body. If a collision occurs, the game will end.
