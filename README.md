# 2D Graphic Demo

The Breakout Game is a two-dimensional game made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is based on the old video game Breakout, in which the player moves a paddle to make a ball bounce and break bricks. The goal is to get rid of all of the bricks on the screen by pushing the ball away from the bottom of the screen with the paddle.

## How the project works:
The following things are part of the game:

In the game Ball and Paddle, the ball bounces off the walls, bricks, and the paddle. The player moves the paddle so that the ball doesn't fall off the bottom of the screen.

### Bricks: 
The bricks on the game screen are set up in groups and rows. To finish the level, the player has to break all of the bricks.

### Levels: 
The game has three levels that get harder as you go up. Each level has a different layout of bricks and the ball moves faster.

### Scoring and Lives:
When a person breaks a brick, they get a point. The game keeps score and keeps track of how many lives the player has left. The player starts with three lives, and if they lose all of them, the game is over.

### How to win and lose:
The player wins the game when all of the bricks on the screen are gone. If the ball hits the bottom of the screen and there are still lives left, the player can keep playing. But if the person runs out of lives, the game is over.

### Key Learning Points:
During the making of this project, there were several key learning points:

### HTML5 Canvas:
The HTML5 canvas element is used to make the game's images and handle the rendering of the game.

### JavaScript Game Development:
The idea was to use JavaScript to make game mechanics. This meant taking care of how the ball moved, how to tell when it hit something, what the user did, and how the game logic worked.

### Event Handling:
The keyboard input for moving the paddle and restarting the game is handled by the game's event listeners.

### Animation and Frame Rendering:
The'requestAnimationFrame' method is used to make animation and frame rendering run smoothly in the game.

## How to Run the Project:
Follow these steps to run the Breakout Game:

- Open the HTML file (called "index.html") that was given to you in a web browser that supports HTML5 painting.

- The game will start on its own, and the player can use the left and right button keys to move the paddle.

- The goal is to get rid of all the bricks on the screen by moving the ball away from them with the paddle.

- The 'R' key can be used to start the game over.

## Attribution:
The logic of the code and the first guide for making a Breakout game came from MDN (Mozilla Developer Network). The original lesson can be found at [the Mozilla documentation.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript) But for this project, the game had to be rewritten from start, including changes to the logic, structure, and design. This was done to make sure the game was original and to avoid plagiarism.
